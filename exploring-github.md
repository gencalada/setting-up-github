TITLE: What am I doing right now?

At the moment I am practicing pushing my work to github. this is my 4th time pushing my changes. do not forget to save your work on vs code before going to the command line and entering "git status" 
to same my work on a mac system, press (command button) + S key



TITLE: correcting document

After I pushed my work to github, I realized the "What" in the first title was spelled wrong. I am now pushing my work up one more time to correct document on my repository by modifying my local document. dont forget to save changes on vs code. command + S key


TITLE: Actually correcting the document

So I actually forgot to correct what I previously wanted to correct. this attempt is to correct that mispelling located in the first title.
